## About me
I'm a long-term fan of mother nature hailing from Tāmaki Makaurau. Being raised by great sailors has influenced my love for the ocean and natural environment. I graduated from *AUT* with Bachelor of Business in Sustainable Enterprise and Design in 2019. After working for two years as an Administration and Marketing Assistant, I decided to return to study at the *University of Auckland*. I am now in my second year studying a Bachelor of Science in GIS and Environmental Science.

When I'm not studying or working, you can find me learning to sail on my Farr 727 called *Bumblebee*, hiking around Aotearoa, or relaxing and crocheting.
