## Blogs

The links below are blogs of my professional and tertiary experiences. Please peruse them at your leisure. 

[WRT Photo Points](https://laura-read.github.io/portfolio/wrt-photo-points.html): my experience interning at the *Waiheke Resource Trust*, focusing on adding a photo points layer to their *Love Our Wetlands Waiheke* map. 

## About me
I'm a long-term fan of mother nature hailing from Tāmaki Makaurau. Being raised by great sailors has influenced my love for the ocean and natural environment. I graduated from *AUT* with Bachelor of Business in Sustainable Enterprise and Design in 2019. After working for two years as an Administration and Marketing Assistant, I decided to return to study at the *University of Auckland*. I am now in my second year studying a Bachelor of Science in GIS and Environmental Science.

When I'm not studying or working, you can find me learning to sail on my Farr 727 called *Bumblebee*, hiking around Aotearoa, or relaxing and crocheting.
